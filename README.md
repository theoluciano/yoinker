# README

This app is meant for my friends out there who are working in large Figma projects and feel like they're losing their minds cause they know they created _that_ component but for the life of them, they can't remember where it was used. Going through each of your many files is a waste of your precious time.

So behold ... I give you.... Yoinker!

---
You'll need a Figma personal access token and the IDs to which teams you want Yoinker to be able to parse through. Just clone the repo, create your .env file and add the token and IDs, bundle it all up, and you'll be in your way!

If you have questions about the architecture, tests, security, vulnerabilities... I'm sorry, I'm not your guy, at least at this moment. I straight up vibe coded this thing in an afternoon and evening.

Hope my dear designers out there are able to keep their hair now that Yoinker is here to help!
